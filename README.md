# Patterns-and-Shapes
Creating patterns and shapes using C &amp; C++ Language.

## Quick Tips To draw any shape 
1. Divide it into multiple shapes (in case of complex shapes).
2. To control the unit height and width of the shape create a nested loop.
```
for(int i = 0; i < height; i++){ // Controls the Height length shape
		
	for(int j = 0; j < width; j++){ // Controls the width length and shape
		
	}
	printf("\n"); // To go to next line
		
}
```
3. The outer loop controls the height and the inner loop controls the width.
4. In case the shape is divided to multiple shapes create a nested loop for each shape indepentendly.
